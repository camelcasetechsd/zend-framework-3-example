# Zend Framework 3 Example

## Development with Docker

Using **Docker** is the preferred way of developing our projects.

1. Clone the git repository locally:
```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:camelcasetech/zend-framework-3-example.git
```

2. Build docker image and run docker.
```
docker-compose up
```
For the first install, **Docker** may take some time as it will download the
images it requires. For subsequent runs, the start up time should be much faster.

3. View the test page:
http://localhost:8080/
